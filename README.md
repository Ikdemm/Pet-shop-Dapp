# Pet-shop-Dapp
Followed the Tutorial made by truffle to get hands dirty with Blockchain Technology and more specifically Ethereum Blockchain.
This decentralized application allows us to reserve pets stored in a pet-shop.
This application relies on:
- Ganache to generate the Ethereum Network
- Metamask to make our browser a "blockchain browser"
- A web interface with basic HTML, CSS and JS
- Smart Contracts and Tests in Solidity
To run this application, you'll need:
- node & npm
- Truffle
- Ganache and Metamask
